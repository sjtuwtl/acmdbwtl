1.Describe any design decisions you made:I use random page eviction algorithom to change the page. This is a little slower than the FIFO.About B+ Tree, I made no special design.2.Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.I spent 3 three days on this project, I build up the model for only 1 day, but I fix my code for the last two days. Liu chang has helped me a lot to fix bugs.3.BugsThere is no equals function in Tuple.java, which cause wrong in BTreeFileInsertTest, and this problem is very hard to discover and wastes me lots of time.
