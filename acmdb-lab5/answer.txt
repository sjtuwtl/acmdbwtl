Design

Tuples:
Just finish all the requirement and do nothing special.

Catalog:
I have tried several data structure and at last found only HashMap can be used. However, exactly it's a good option to write a structure of oneself.

BufferPool:
I set the Permission to be always Read_Write and tried to use FIFO to remove the page.

HeapFile:
I implemented a HeapFileIterator implementing DbFileIterator to complete the iterator.




Missing
Nothing is missed.




Time
I spend about 10 hours to complete the project,and I think "2.6. Operators" is the most difficult and I spent most of my time on it.
