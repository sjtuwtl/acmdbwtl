1.Describe any design decisions you made£º	I use LRU evict, because I think FIFO is not a good idea for it.2. Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API:	I ignore two functions: public DbIterator[] getChildren() and public void setChildren(DbIterator[] children) in all the classes, because I think there is no reason to apply them.3. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.	Nothing.4.Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.	I finish my code in about 10 days.
